## **List of functionalities:**

Each folder contains screenshot examples for final result.


### **-Scrollable popup AI:**

Originally used to have students agree to our institution-wide AI policy the first time they visit a new course.
Shows a popup with scrollable textbox to every user JUST THE FIRST TIME they open a new course. The "I Agree" button is not clickable until the texbot is scrolled all the way to the bottom. See screenshots in the folder for example.
Knows issues: the code breaks if the text in the main body is not long enought to be scrolled and people cant Agree. DO NOT USE FOR SHORT TEXT.
